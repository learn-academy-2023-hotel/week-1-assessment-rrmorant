# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: A conditional statement use if/else statements different operators to get an output based on met conditions.

Researched answer: Decision structures, also called decision trees, conditional statements, or if/else statements, are fundamental to computer programming. Conditional statements are a sequence of well-defined instructions that produce a unique output based on the value of the input. Conditionals follow a flowchart-like structure and allow for logic within the code. -Learn Academy Syllabus, JavaScript Conditionals

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a system that allow developers to work together on different projects by allowing them to create local repositories to maintain version control.

Researched answer: Git is a distributed version control system, which means that a local clone of the project is a complete version control repository. These fully functional local repositories make it easy to work offline or remotely. Developers commit their work locally, and then sync their copy of the repository with the copy on the server. This paradigm differs from centralized version control where clients must synchronize code with a server before creating new versions of code. -https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/devops/develop/git/what-is-git


2. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: The index is the location of the value within the array. The index starts at 0 for the first value of the array.

Researched answer: Every value in an array has a particular location known as the index. Indexes are sequential numbers that are a bit like an address for every element in the array. Arrays are zero indexed which means the elements are numbered starting with the number 0 and increase by one whole number for each new element. -Learn Academy Syllabus, Javascript Arrays, Index

3. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are a collection of data types, that can include strings, listed in order starting staring with a 0 index. Strings are characters, such as numbers and letters within quotations marks. They also start with a 0 index.

Researched answer: Strings are a collection of characters wrapped in quotation marks. Strings can contain any type of characters and as many characters as needed. Arrays are variables that store collections of data in an ordered list. Arrays also have many built-in methods that can be used to manipulate and access the content. -Learn Academy Syllabus.

4. STRETCH: What are the four pillars of object oriented programming?

Researched answer: The four pillars of object oriented programming are abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms. Hint: use the syllabus!

1. Higher Order Functions: Built in methods in Javascrupt and are a specific subset of built in methods that take a function as an arguement. Often higher-ordered functions are designed to operate on arrays.

2. Jest: Is a Javascript testing framework and is made up of a collection of files called dependencies which contain snippets of code functionality.

3. Objects: Consist of collection of key:value pairs within curly bracets and the key is a data type of symbol and the value is any valid data type.
