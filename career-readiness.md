# ASSESSMENT 1: Career Readiness

The LEARN program focuses on readying our students for a career in technology. The job hunt is a daunting process that requires a lot of preparedness. Complete the following tasks to ensure progress in your professional development.

LinkedIn is the world's largest online professional networking community. An active presence on LinkedIn allows you to make professional connections, look for employment opportunities, connect with others who share your interests, and learn more about the tech industry.

- Submit your "about me" statement:

Understanding the “how” has always been something I aimed for, never satisfied with just the end state. After serving 20 years of military service, I always had an interest in tech and wanting to understand the behind the scenes of what we see on our phones and web browsers. Learning with individuals that have the same passion is the most exciting part of attending LEARN, because we are able to lean on each other now, tomorrow, and possibly in the far future.
